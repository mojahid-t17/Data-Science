    "* The Naive Bayes classifier is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks such as text classification. It belongs to the family of generative learning algorithms, which means that it models the distribution of inputs for a given class or category. This approach is based on the assumption that the features of the input data are conditionally independent given the class, allowing the algorithm to make predictions quickly and accurately."

    "## Different Types of Naive Bayes Classifiers\n",
    "There are several types of Naive Bayes classifiers, each designed to handle different types of data\n",
    "1. Gaussian Naive Bayes: This type of Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the features of the input data are normally distributed. It is commonly used for continuous data.\n",
    "2. Multinomial Naive Bayes: This type of Naive Bayes classifier is used for discrete data, such as **text classification**. It models the distribution of word counts in documents.\n",
    "3. Bernoulli Naive Bayes: This type of Naive Bayes classifier is also used for discrete data, but it models the presence or absence of features rather than their counts. It is commonly used for **binary classification** tasks."
