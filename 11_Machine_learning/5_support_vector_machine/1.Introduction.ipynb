    "* A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. This finds the best line (or hyperplane) to separate data into groups, maximizing the distance between the closest points (support vectors) of each group. It can handle complex data using  **Kernel** to transform it into higher dimensions. In short, SVM helps classify data effectively.\n"

    "### How Does Support Vector Machine Algorithm Work?\n",
    "SVM is defined such that it is defined in terms of the support vectors only, we don’t have to worry about other observations since the margin is made using the points which are closest to the hyperplane (support vectors), whereas in logistic regression the classifier is defined over all the points. Hence SVM enjoys some natural speed-ups.\n",
